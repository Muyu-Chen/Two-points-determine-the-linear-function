⚠️ **注意**：这个仓库建立于2019年4月1日，  
当时作者正值初中，英语和编程都菜得一塌糊涂，  
所以现在重新回味时无地自容，因此把程序的部分printf语句进行了修改，   
把初中中二的语句修改得更加得体一些，  
顺便把编译出来的二进制程序放在了release里，而不是仓库里。  
但是这部分代码确实也是我初中时独一无二的记忆，因此我也不希望这份记忆丢失，   
因此我决定保留这部分代码，不进行任何大的重构，  
希望各位看官不要在意。  

⚠️ **Note**: This repository was created on April 1, 2019,    
when I was still in middle school, and both my English and programming skills were quite poor.  
Looking back now, I feel somewhat embarrassed, so I modified some of the `printf` statements  
to make the text a bit more proper and less immature.  
I've also moved the compiled binaries to the Releases section instead of keeping them in the repository.  
However, this code holds unique memories from my middle school days,  
and I don't want to lose these memories.  
Therefore, I've decided not to make any major changes to the code.  
Please bear with me and don't mind the old code too much.
